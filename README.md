# Chess_JS
Making a simple chess game using minimax algorithm... Still in development... Possible moves for a piece are working (except castling and capture en passe) 
The chess pieces (.png images) should be in a folder in the root folder names 'Pieces'. The root folder should also contain all the other files (index.html, style.css, etc). Open index.html to "play"/test
